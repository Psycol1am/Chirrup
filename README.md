This is my FullStack web assignment submission where I created a full stack website that acted as a twitter like website  in which you could use to create posts and find people and like their posts/follow them.

I had to create a twitter like website that adhered to an api spec my lecturer had made.  The code is fully in Nodejs and also uses vue for the front end with also a bit of bootstrap for the basic design of the website. 

I was marked on tests passing using npm run test for the back end. And then for the front end we was marked on overall ux and amount of backend implemented. 

npm install before running.
